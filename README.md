1. Introduction

Phishing remains one of the most prevalent cyber threats affecting organizations worldwide. Unlike technical exploits that target system vulnerabilities, phishing attacks exploit human behavior through deception, urgency, and impersonation techniques.

This project presents an analytical review of phishing email samples, identifies key indicators of compromise, classifies associated risks, and outlines preventive awareness measures.
